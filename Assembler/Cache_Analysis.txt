For test one we got the best results from having a cache size of 5 with a block size of 8 (99% hit).  
Lower cache sizes drastically reduced the hit count, while higher cache sizes seemed to increase it.
Having the block size at one and the cache size at two produced a 53% ratio of hit/miss, which was
extremely suprising that it was so low.  Overall the block size did not have nearly as much impact in our tests
as the cache size did.  Increasing the cache size to a large number often cause the ratio to be between 98-100%.
Direct map generally performed better at lower cache sizes, but noticably was worse than two way associative.
Two way associative saw much better performance at higher cache and block sizes in most of our tests.
